<!-- Our Approach -->

The approach to mapping tree species sensitivity builds upon Dr. Joan Dudney and Dr. Robert Heilmayr's on-going research to understand how trees are responding to drought. Tree sensitivity quantifies a species response to changes in water availability, and is calculated using historic climatic water deficit (CWD) which measures water and energy availability. Sensitivity is unique to each species and varies across individual species ranges. The following projections map 26 individual tree species to investigate variations in tree sensitivity.

We have developed a reproducible workflow to measure and map how reactive tress are to changes in climatic water deficit, based on historic measures of these variables.
