# Mapping Tree Species Drought Sensitivity Under Climate Change

#### Sensitivity to Water Availabilty

Although droughts are a regular occurrence, climate change is causing an increase in drought severity and length.
These climate-induced droughts are having a range of effects on global forests. Understanding where and how forests respond to stressors such as drought is crucial for conservation efforts.

The goal of this analysis and dashboard is to explore the effects of climatic water deficit on tree species, and how this sensitivity varies across a species range. We have mapped species and region specific sensitivity for 26 species within the International Tree Ring Data Bank.


#### Why We Built This Dashboard

To support conservation and land management by providing drought sensitivity estimates for multiple tree species. Our goal is to support informed conservation and land management strategies by providing robust estimates of drought sensitivity, tailored to individual tree species. To accomplish this, we have estimated species-level sensitivity using historic tree ring growth, and converted it into an easy-to-interpret sensitivity level variable.
